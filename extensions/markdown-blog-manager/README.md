Props @thomaspaulmann - Quite a bit of the file management is inspired by [Downloads Manager](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/downloads-manager) extension


## Ignore

You might want to ignore some files inside the blog directories.

In the root of each of you content directories (drafts and published posts), you can add a file called `.ray-ignore` and specify glob patterns to ignore for that directory:

```
archive/*
special-post.md
```
